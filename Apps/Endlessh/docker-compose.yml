          description:
            en_us: The endless banner is sent one line at a time. This is the delay in milliseconds between individual lines.
        - container: MAXLINES
          description:
            en_us: The length of each line is randomized. This controls the maximum length of each line. Shorter lines may keep clients on for longer if they give up after a certain number of bytes.
        - container: MAXCLIENTS
          description:
            en_us: Maximum number of connections to accept at a time. Connections beyond this are not immediately rejected, but will wait in the queue.
        - container: LOGFILE
          description:
            en_us: By default, the app logs to container log. If this is set to true, the log will be output to file under /config/logs/endlessh (/config needs to be mapped).

          description:
            en_us: By default, the app binds to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Set it to 4 or 6 to bind to IPv4 only or IPv6 only, respectively. Leave blank to bind to both.

  tagline:
    en_us: An SSH tarpit that very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner. It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days at a time. The purpose is to put your real SSH server on another port and then let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit instead of bothering a real server.
